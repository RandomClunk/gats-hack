A hack for gats.io

### About
I created this hack in early 2020 as a challenge for myself as I had just started programming. It was quite fun to use in game as well. At the time I was the only one who had access to it. After about 3 months, I started giving my friends access to it aswell. That is where it all went down. One of them shared it without my permission even when I explicitly told them to never share it. Eventuallly, someone who had bad intentions got access to it. They tried to make money off of my work. Whenever I shared it with a friend, I told them "If you ever share it and it spreads, I will make it public so people dont try to sell it for money." Well thats why I made this repository. The hack is available here for anyone to use.

### Information
- I havent updated it since I first created the finalised version 1 year ago
- I made it when I first started programming so please ignore any code style and javascript language features I used
- I spent 0 time trying to make the code readable. I just hacked it all together

### Dangers of using modified versions of the hack
- Your account can get stolen
- You may have to pay and thus also have a chance of getting scammed
- You can have your pc infected with viruses/malware

### How to install
1. Download [tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) for chrome
2. Go to the tampermonkey dashboard and click Create a New Script
3. Copy the contents of the hack from hack.js
4. Delete all of the default script contents from tampermonkey
5. Paste the script into tampermonkey
6. Press `Ctrl + s` to save
7. Refresh gats.io and enjoy


### How to use
- You can enable the modules that you want to use
- When binocs is enabled you can use the `-` and `+` keys to change the zoom level
- When aimbot is enabled you can hold shift to activate it
- Use the `h` key to toggle the visibility of the GUI

If you have any problems with the hack you can open an issue at https://github.com/RandomClunk/gats-hack/issues/new

### Known issues (that I never bothered to fix)
- If you enable and disable thermal while spawned in, it will stay active until you die and respawn
- `Show enemny names` is buggy

### Extra
If you have found a modified version of the hack, you can open an issue and attach the hack file. I will take a look at it and verify if it is safe to use or not. Just dont use it before I respond (ofc?).

### For the gats devs
I really hope this forces an update. I didnt want to share it but had to. If you are reading this, then heres what you can do.
<br>
Aimbot - You could detect it but it will be hard<br>
Thermal - Cannot be patched<br>
Binoculors - The clients server FOV should only increase when they select the binocs perk. This will require a decision on what the default width and height will be but im sure you can handle that. Also will require better scaling on the client.<br>

I have made many other hacks for gats.io which havent gone public yet. You can contact me and I can help you fix them. Discord: `Random Clunk#1134`
